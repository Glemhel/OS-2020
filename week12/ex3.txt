I create files of needed size with the use of "truncate -s *size* *filename* "
Results I got:


BUF_SIZE = 16.
FILE_SIZE = 1B.         FILE_SIZE = 10MB        FILE_SIZE = 700MB
real    0m0,002s        real    0m1,024s        real    1m14,030s
user    0m0,000s        user    0m0,276s        user    0m20,568s
sys     0m0,002s        sys     0m0,748s        sys     0m53,351s


BUF_SIZE = 1024.
FILE_SIZE = 1B.         FILE_SIZE = 10MB        FILE_SIZE = 700MB
real    0m0,003s        real    0m0,063s        real     0m1,709s
user    0m0,000s        user    0m0,021s        user     0m0,360s
sys     0m0,002s        sys     0m0,042s        sys      0m1,350s


BUF_SIZE = 2020000.
FILE_SIZE = 1B.         FILE_SIZE = 10MB        FILE_SIZE = 700MB
real    0m0,095s        real    0m0,042s        real     0m0,878s
user    0m0,000s        user    0m0,001s        user     0m0,004s
sys     0m0,091s        sys     0m0,037s        sys      0m0,597s

With O_SYNC:

BUF_SIZE = 16.
FILE_SIZE = 1B.         FILE_SIZE = 10MB
real    0m0,009s        real   0m39,422s 
user    0m0,000s        user    0m0,107s 
sys     0m0,007s        sys     0m1,453s


BUF_SIZE = 1024.
FILE_SIZE = 10MB        FILE_SIZE =  30MB
real    0m6,341s        real    0m18,675s
user    0m0,026s        user     0m0,033s
sys     0m0,341s        sys      0m0,843s

So, as wee see, with O_SYNC on perfomance decreases, in general.
And buffer size affects the perfomance the following way: if it's size is <= size of data copied,
then the more - the better. But if size of the buffer is greater than the size of the data, perfomance increases
with the increase of the size. Obviously, with the same small buffer and file size smaller files are transferred faster
than the bigger ones.

Point about BUF_SIZE is clear: if buffer has excessive size for the data, is still has to be used on the full size, so
time depends on the buffer. When data is bigger, it depends on how big buffer is relative to the data size.

Point about O_SYNC: this flag guarantees(not always stil..) that the copy program returns only after all data was actually
transferred, while abcense of this flag let the OS do something internal or postpone the actual data copy, letting user further
interact with the system.
