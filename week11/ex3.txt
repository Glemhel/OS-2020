Program 1 prints:
Hello
Hello

---
Program 2 prints:
Hello


---

So, as we see, "Hello" + "\n" is printed twice in Program 1,
while in Program 2 "Hello" is printed only once, but "\n" is printed three times.

This happens due to buffer flush before fork in Program 2 compared to Program 1.

In Program 1, output buffer is not flushed(by \n) before fork. Thus, the fork happens before the content of the
buffer was outputted and released, so in both processes "Hello" is inside the buffer. When "\n" is printed,
in both processes string "Hello\n" is released from the buffer to the stdout, as we really see.

In Program 2, in contrast, buffer was cleared before fork(). Therefore, string "Hello\n" is printed, buffer is empty
now, and then fork happens. In fork, only "\n" is printed by both processes, so 3 "\n" overall.
