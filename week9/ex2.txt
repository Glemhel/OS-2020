As we see, for sample test file from Moodle number of hits is around N (number of page frames),
so the ratio is around (N / 10) %.

---INCREASE---
If we want to increase the ratio, we might want to do one of the following: decrease the number of different pages requested,
or place requests in such a way that the same page is requested frequently, e.g. around 1 in N requests.
Such tests are provided in input2.txt and input3.txt respectively.
Input2.txt: Generated numbers randomly.
200 different pages exist.
Outputs:
    N = 100: 0.478000
    N = 50: 0.244000
    N = 10: 0.055000
65 different pages exist:
Outputs:
    N = 100: 0.935000
    N = 50: 0.742000
    N = 10: 0.166000
14 different pages exist:
Outputs:
    N = 100: 0.986000
    N = 50: 0.986000
    N = 10: 0.710000

As we see, ratio is increased even for N = 10.

Input3.txt: (only for N = 10): Manually constructed relatively small sequence of numbers that fit our condition.
Output: 0.822222

---DECREASE---
Obviously, we need to do the opposite: increase number of queryied pages or space requests more evenly along the whole query sequence.
We will do it both at the same time by generating random numbers in large interval in input4.txt

Input4.txt:
2451 different pages exist:
Outputs:
    N = 100: 0.032000
    N = 50: 0.015000
    N = 10: 0.002000

Ratios decreased
