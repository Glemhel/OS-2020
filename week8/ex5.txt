Physical address is a real address that can be used while working on a machine - we can write and read
stuff from it, this is a real address in our memory.
However, virtual address is not a real part of memory. Due to large needs of programs, they use virtual address space
abstraction. They use virtual address as it was real. But in reality, special MMU maps virtual addresses to 
real physical addresses properly. Although it may happen that not every virtual address is mapped to a physical address as
there are not enough real memory on the computer, virtual adresseses 'take turns' to be used and executed on a device when their
time has come.
So, physical address is real part of memory, while virtual address is like a promise to a process that it has its own memory, while
this virtual adress(or its part if it's too big) is mapped to some physical address.
